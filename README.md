## Repository info
This repo contains a copy of latest released [version 2018.07](http://csse.usc.edu/ucc_new/wordpress/2018/07/26/ucc-version-2018-07/) sources:
> Finally! Our next, and last, UCC release! We have decided to focus on UCC-Java, so that it has all the features UCC currently does. Hence, I have decided to make this release available to everyone.

[Release notes](UCC_release_notes_v.2018.07.pdf), [user manual](UCC_user_manual_v.2018.07.pdf) are available as PDFs. Also you can find line count and cyclomatic complexity metric calculation rules in `Counting Rules` subdirectory.

The tool successfully compiles under Linux, yet it's somewhat buggy and doesn't provide complete support for modern languages' standards.
